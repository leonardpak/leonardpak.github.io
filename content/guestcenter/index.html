						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							OpenTable is the top restaurant reservation service in North America. While most OpenTable users <em>book</em> reservations, restaurants use OpenTable to <em>manage</em> reservations.<br />
							<br />
							For most of OpenTable's history, reservations were managed through a Windows desktop application called the Electronic Reservation Book (ERB). The design and technology didn't age well.
						</p>

							<p class="caption for_single_image">Screenshot of OpenTable's legacy Electronic Reservation Book (ERB) software, showing a restaurant floor plan.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Later, OpenTable launched Guest Center for iPad, a more modern take on managing reservations, with features like cloud-based reservation data storage, multi-device support, etc.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">

							<p class="caption for_single_image">Screenshot of OpenTable's modern Guest Center application, showing a restaurant floor plan and reservation information.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I joined OpenTable's restaurant product team as a lead product designer during this initial launch period. My contributions helped customers transition to the new product and built the foundation for a responsive web version of the product.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<section id="problem">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							While new customers loved Guest Center, old customers hesitated to transition. Guest Center's initial release focused on establishing an initial product foundation, but was missing certain functionality important to certain restaurants.<br />
							<br />
							How would the team bridge the gap, while keeping a user-centered approach, without repeating the mistakes of the past?
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The following are examples of features I worked on to help fill in missing functionality.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== FEATURE: TAGGING GUESTS AND RESERVATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Feature: tagging guests and reservations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Many classier restaurants take notes on guests and their visits in order to provide better service. Tagging helps quickly record and display various notes.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/tags_foh_add.gif" width="1380" alt="Animation showing a host adding tags for a reservation in Guest Center" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Excerpt from a desigm prototype for a restaurant host to select tags on a reservation's details page. <span>Work credit: Leonard "Leo" Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/tags_boh_create.gif" width="1380" alt="Animation showing a manager creating tags in Guest Center" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Excerpt from a design prototype for a restaurant manager to add new tags for restaurant hosts to use. <span>Work credit: Leonard "Leo" Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Guest Center has different interfaces for restaurant hosts (front-of-house, or FOH) and restaurant managers (back-of-house, or BOH), so I created designs for both interfaces for each feature.<br />
							<br />
							I also conducted research with restaurants and OpenTable staff (who would install Guest Center for restaurants) to iterate on designs over time.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== FEATURE: SECURING GUEST CENTER WITH A PASSCODE =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Feature: securing Guest Center with a passcode</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Guest Center could put much power into the hands of restaurant employees. For example, restaurant hosts could choose to overbook a restaurant or block incoming reservations. A security passcode was needed to avoid misuse.<br />
							<br />
							My work on this feature illustrates my typical design process well:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Stakeholder interviews and reviewing existing research</span></li>
								<li><span>Listing out primary and fringe use case scenarios</span></li>
								<li><span>Sketching potential flowcharts for each use case scenario</span></li>
								<li><span>Sketching potential screens for each flowchart step</span></li>
								<li><span>Receiving initial feedback and iterating on the sketches</span></li>
								<li><span>Wireframing and/or mocking up interface screens</span></li>
								<li><span>Receiving further feedback and iterating on the wireframes/mockups</span></li>
								<li><span>Prototyping (and animating) the design</span></li>
								<li><span>Usability testing and iterating upon the design</span></li>
							</ol>

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Along with documentation explaining the design (as necessary), I specified how the designs should be componentized for the web application and illustrated examples of how the final design should look.

						<!-- =========== FEATURE: PROVIDING A MONTHLY OVERVIEW OF RESERVATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Feature: providing a monthly overview of reservations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							A legacy OpenTable product allowed casual restaurants to view a monthly overview of reservations, which Guest Center had unfortunately lacked.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/legacy_month.png" width="1380" alt="A screenshot of the former product's month overview" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">A screenshot of a legacy product's monthly overview, which allowed hovering over dates and looking at icons to understand reservation activity.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							To better understand why casual restaurants depended on it, I went to interview multiple users of the legacy product in casual restaurants at San Francisco.<br />
							<br />
							Through the research, we came away with some insights which can't be shared publicly. However, some specific takeaways were that:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Casual restaurants didn't typically look at reservations in the past, unless checking for records.</span></li>
								<li><span>Casual restaurants wanted easy awareness of shifts or days that were booked full, blocked from incoming reservations, or closed.</span></li>
								<li><span>Casual restaurants wanted an easy way to glance shifts or days that weren't empty anymore.</span></li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Per this research, I designed multiple iterations incorporating the feedback and later usability tested to validate the results.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/month_iteration1.png" width="1380" alt="The earliest iteration of the new month overview" />
							<img src="img/month_iteration2.png" width="1380" alt="A later iteration of the new month overview" />
							<img src="img/month_iteration3.png" width="1380" alt="The last iteration of the new month overview for development of first release" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Different iterations of the new month view, from early iteration to final iteration. <span>Work credit: Leonard "Leo" Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I also provided technical details for how to build the month view responsively.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Guest Center has continued to get more customers through fleshing out capabilities and working toward a self-service model (see the self-service signup wireframes excerpt below for another design example).<br />
							<br />
							OpenTable was a good learning experience for me to better understand the challenges of transitioning from legacy softwares. 
							During my time at OpenTable, I also took on some design team leadership responsibilities focused on team logistics and collaborating with a remote team.
							OpenTable was also one of my best experiences working collaboratively with product managers and engineers.

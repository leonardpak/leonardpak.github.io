						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							OpenTable is the top restaurant reservation service in North America. While most OpenTable users <em>book</em> reservations, restaurants use OpenTable software to <em>manage</em> reservations.<br />
							<br />
							For most of OpenTable's history, reservations were managed through a desktop application called the Electronic Reservation Book. The design and technology behind it hadn't aged well.
						</p>

							<p class="caption for_single_image">Screenshot of OpenTable's legacy Electronic Reservation Book software, showing a restaurant floor plan.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In <time>2014</time>, OpenTable launched Guest Center for iPad, a more modern take on managing reservations, with features like cloud-based reservation data storage, multi-device support, etc.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/guestcenter_tableview.png" width="1380" alt="Screenshot of OpenTable's Guest Center, showing a restaurant floor plan and reservation information." />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Screenshot of OpenTable's Guest Center, showing a restaurant floor plan and placeholder reservation information.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I joined OpenTable's restaurant product team as a lead designer during this initial product launch period. My contributions helped customers transition to the new product and helped build the foundation for a responsive web platform version of the product.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<section id="problem">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							While new customers loved Guest Center, old customers hesitated to transition. Guest Center's initial release focused on establishing a product foundation, but was missing functionality that was key to the operations of certain restaurants.<br />
							<br />
							How was the team to bridge the gap, while keeping a user-centered approach, without repeating the mistakes of the past?
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The following are examples of features I worked on to help fill in some of the missing functionality.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== FEATURE: TAGGING GUESTS AND RESERVATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Feature: tagging guests and reservations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Many restaurants take notes on guests and their future visits in order to provide better service. Tagging provides a means to quickly record and display these notes.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/tags_foh_add.gif" width="1380" alt="Animation showing a host adding tags for a reservation in Guest Center" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Excerpt from a design iteration's prototype for a restaurant host to select tags on a reservation details page. <span>Work credit: Leonard Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/tags_boh_create.gif" width="1380" alt="Animation showing a manager creating tags in Guest Center" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Excerpt from a design iteration's prototype for a restaurant manager to add new tags for restaurant hosts to use. <span>Work credit: Leonard Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Guest Center has different interfaces and usage scenarios for restaurant hosts and restaurant managers, so I would often create iterations for both interfaces for each feature.<br />
							<br />
							I would also often conduct research with restaurants and OpenTable service staff (who would set up Guest Center for new OpenTable restaurants) to iterate on the designs over time.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== FEATURE: SECURING GUEST CENTER WITH A PASSCODE =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Feature: securing Guest Center with a passcode</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Guest Center could put a lot of power into the hands of restaurant employees. For example, hosts could overbook a restaurant or block incoming reservations. A layer of security was needed for managers to oversee these actions.<br />
							<br />
							My work on this feature illustrates my typical design process well (after having talked to stakeholders and reviewed research):

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Along with documentation explaining the design (as needed), I communicated how my designs should be componentized for the web application version of Guest Center and illustrated examples of how the final design should look.

						<!-- =========== FEATURE: PROVIDING A MONTHLY OVERVIEW OF RESERVATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Feature: providing a month overview of reservations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							A legacy restaurant product that got merged into the Guest Center platform had previously offered a month overview of reservations. Restaurants that depended on it weren't happy that Guest Center lacked it.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/legacy_month.png" width="1380" alt="A screenshot of the former product's month overview" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">A screenshot of the legacy product's month overview, in which you could hover over dates and look at symbols to see reservation activity.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							To better understand why restaurants had depended on it, I went to interview multiple users of the previous product.<br />
							<br />
							Through the research, we came away with some insights about OpenTable, Guest Center, and the month view &mdash; most of which I can't share publicly. However, some specific takeaways for the interface were that:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Restaurants didn't typically look at shifts or days in the past, unless for checking records.</span></li>
								<li><span>Restaurants wanted easy awareness of shifts or days that were booked full, blocked from incoming reservations, or closed.</span></li>
								<li><span>Restaurants wanted a glance-able way to see shifts or days that weren't empty anymore.</span></li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Consequently, I worked on multiple iterations that incorporated the feedback and later tested to validate the results.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/month_iteration1.png" width="1380" alt="The earliest iteration of the new month overview" />
							<img src="img/month_iteration2.png" width="1380" alt="A later iteration of the new month overview" />
							<img src="img/month_iteration3.png" width="1380" alt="The last iteration of the new month overview for development of first release" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">A few iterations of the new month view, from an early iteration to the final iteration for development of first release. <span>Work credit: Leonard Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Alongside, working through the design of several iterations, I also supplied technical details for how to build the month view responsively.
						</p>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The Guest Center platform has continued to gather more customers by fleshing out capabilities and working toward a self-service model for joining the OpenTable network. As of <time>2016</time>, the web platform version of Guest Center is nearing completion.<br />
							<br />
							OpenTable was a good learning experience for me to better understand the difficulties of transitioning from legacy softwares. I'm also thankful for having been entrusted with some design leadership responsibilities. It's been one of my best experiences working collaboratively with product managers and engineers.

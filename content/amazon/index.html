						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Amazon is the largest online retailer and cloud service provider in the world, with Amazon Photos being their photo storage, sharing, and printing service for consumers.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/echoshow.jpg" width="1380" alt="Browsing albums on the Amazon Photos app on the smart device, the Echo Show" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Browsing albums using voice or touch on the Echo Show. The Photos experience encompasses many platforms and touchpoints.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							My role encompassed both design managerial responsibilities for a team of 15+ design employees, and lead design work for desktop/mobile web, iOS, Android, television, and smart devices.
							In the following org chart, you can see my managerial people scope.

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<section id="problem">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							When I first joined the Amazon Photos team, design employees were working in silos, reporting directly to product managers. 
							However, this wasn't scaling well, as the design team grew beyond 10 employees. Design inconsistencies, process gaps, knowledge silos, etc. were increasingly the norm.<br />
							<br />
							As a hybrid design manager/individual contributor hire, how would I help resolve these types of issues, while also delivering design work for multiple platforms/devices?
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The management/design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As a design manager, I sought to centralize design operations. These changes could be summarized as:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Centralizing team operations</span></li>
								<li><span>Centralizing project management</span></li>
								<li><span>Centralizing people management</span></li>
								<li><span>Establishing design principles</span></li>
								<li><span>Establishing best practices</span></li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<!-- =========== CENTRALIZING TEAM OPERATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing team operations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I instituted changes for design employees to work more as a team. 
							This included simple logistical adjustments, like utilizing team email, team chat, team wiki pages, shared tools/services, shared asset management, etc., 
							but also included building habits to feel more like a team, like weekly design reviews and a shared seating in the same area of the building.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/designreviews.jpg" width="1380" alt="Photograph of a team design review being held in the newly arranged design team area. " />

						<!-- =========== CENTRALIZING PROJECT MANAGEMENT =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing project management</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In order to manage workloads, I started a designer roadmap, transparently made available to help others understand resource allocation. 
							I also started project managing design team-initiated work on design systems and UI redesign projects.
						</p>

						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing people management</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I started managing the team through setting up 1:1s, interviewing/hiring, setting up onboarding, running performance reviews, allocating designers to trainings, etc.
						</p>
						
						<!-- =========== ESTABLISHING DESIGN PRINCIPLES =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Establishing design principles</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I ran brainstorming workshops with the designers to align on team design principles:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Secure: make photo storage reliable, safe, private</li>
								<li>Accessible: make photos searchable and shareable</li>
								<li>Memorable: make memorable moments shine</li>
								<li>Easy to use: make our products easy to learn over time</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Furthermore, a similar exercise was done to define what team culture we wanted to have: fun, transparent, mindful, compassionate, and striving to share and improve.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ESTABLISHING BEST PRACTICES =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Establishing best practices (through delivering individual contributor design works)</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As a design leader, I shared my individual contributor design works at design share meetings to help establish best practices. 
							This included showcasing screen flows, prototypes, automated redlining of designs, and usage of usability testing services. 
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">

							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							Oftentimes I filled in for design needs throughout the organization, such as for these projects:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>iOS/Android mobile: sharing photos to groups of friends/family</li>
								<li>Desktop/mobile web: viewing of shared photos</li>
								<li>Android/Fire Tablet: displaying personalized photo recommendations</li>
								<li>Windows/macOS desktop apps: photos syncing to Amazon Photos service</li>
								<li>Fire TV smart television: home screen and viewing of shared photos</li>
								<li>Fire TV smart television: photo screensaver with Alexa hints and advertisements</li>
								<li>Echo Show/Spot smart devices: voice prompted image search</li>

					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The results (and some reflection)</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Amazon had traditionally been engineering and product driven, and only in the few years before my tenure, had started to incorporate design-centric organizational practices.<br />
							<br />
							During my tenure, while completing some individual contributor work across multiple platforms,  I was able to take on many managerial responsibilities 
							and learned a lot about establishing a centralized design team. We grew our team headcount by roughly 50%, while setting up a good foundation for improved design work in the future.<br />
							<br />
							In hindsight, some other initiatives I wish I could have worked on to improve our design foundation and culture includes:
						</p>
						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Creating a better collaborative design space</li>
								<li>Encouraging more paired design work</li>
								<li>Being an earlier participant in organizational roadmapping</li>
								<li>Hiring a DesignOps specialist and a mobile technologist</li>
								<li>Establishing presentation/documentation templates</li>
								<li>Establishing a transparently visibile design issue backlog</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I hope that in future roles, I can continue to shape design orgs' operations, culture, coaching, and foundations.
						</p>

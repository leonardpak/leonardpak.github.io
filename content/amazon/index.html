						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Amazon is the largest online retailer and cloud service provider in the world. 
							Amazon Photos is their photo storage, sharing, and printing service for consumers, available on desktop, tablet, mobile, web, television, and smart device platforms.

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							When I first joined the Amazon Photos team, design employees were reporting directly to product managers. 
							However, this arrangement wasn't scaling well as the design team was growing beyond 10 employees. Design inconsistencies, process gaps, knowledge silos, etc. were becoming increasingly common.<br />
							<br />
							As a hybrid manager/individual contributor hire, how would I help resolve these team issues, while also delivering design work for multiple devices?

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As a design manager, I sought to centralize design operations to reduce fragmentation. These changes could be summarized as:

						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing team operations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As designers had been working in silos, I made changes for the design employees to operate more as a team. 
							This ranged from logistical changes like newly created shared team email, chat rooms, wiki pages, tools, asset management, etc., 
							to building habits to feel more like a team, like holding weekly design reviews and moving seating to the same area of the building.

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The results (and some reflection)</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							During my tenure, I was able to establish centralized team processes/outputs and grow team headcount by roughly 50%.<br />
							<br />
							
							Guest Center has continued to get more customers through fleshing out capabilities and working toward a self-service model (see the self-service signup wireframes excerpt below for another design example).<br />
							<br />
							OpenTable was a good learning experience for me to better understand the challenges of transitioning from legacy softwares. 
							During my time at OpenTable, I also took on some design team leadership responsibilities focused on team logistics and collaborating with a remote team.
							OpenTable was also one of my best experiences working collaboratively with product managers and engineers.

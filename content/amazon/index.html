						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Amazon is the largest online retailer and cloud service provider in the world, with Amazon Photos being their photo storage, sharing, and printing service for consumers.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/echoshow.jpg" width="1380" alt="Browsing albums on the Amazon Photos app on the smart device, the Echo Show" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">Browsing albums using voice or touch on the Amazon Photos app on the Echo Show. The Photos experience encompasses many platforms and touchpoints.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							My role encompassed both design managerial responsibilities for a team of 15+ design employees, and lead design work for desktop/mobile web, iOS, Android, television, and smart devices.
							In the following org chart, you can see my managerial people scope.

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<section id="problem">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							When I first joined the Amazon Photos team, design employees were working in silos, reporting directly to product managers. 
							However, this wasn't scaling well as the design team grew beyond 10 employees. Design inconsistencies, process gaps, knowledge silos, etc. were becoming increasingly common.<br />
							<br />
							As a hybrid design manager/individual contributor hire, how would I help resolve these types of issues, while also delivering design work for multiple platforms/devices?
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The management/design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As a design manager, I sought to centralize design operations to reduce fragmentation. These changes could be summarized as:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Centralizing team operations</span></li>
								<li><span>Centralizing project management</span></li>
								<li><span>Centralizing people management</span></li>
								<li><span>Establishing design principles and team culture</span></li>
								<li><span>Establishing best practices for design process/delivery</span></li>
								<li><span>Establishing better cross-functional collaboration</span></li>
								<li><span>Contributing to the greater Amazon design community</span></li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<!-- =========== CENTRALIZING TEAM OPERATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing team operations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I instituted changes for the design employees to work more as a team. 
							This included from simple logistical adjustments like utilizing team email, team chat, team wiki pages, shared tools/services, shared asset management, etc., 
							but also included building habits to feel more like a team, like weekly design reviews and shared seating in the same area of the building.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/designreviews.jpg" width="1380" alt="Photograph of a team design review being held in the newly arranged design team area. " />

						<!-- =========== CENTRALIZING PROJECT MANAGEMENT =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing project management</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In order to manage workloads, I started a designer roadmap, made visibile to both designers and stakeholders for transparency. 
							I also started project managing progress on design systems and UI redesign projects.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== CENTRALIZING PEOPLE MANAGEMENT =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing people management</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I started managing the team through setting up 1:1s, creating job listings, interviewing/hiring, setting up onboarding processes, running performance reviews, allocating designers to trainings, etc.
						</p>
						
						<!-- =========== ESTABLISHING DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND TEAM CULTURE =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Establishing design principles and team culture</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I ran brainstorming workshops with the team to align on design principles:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Secure: make photo storage reliable, safe, private</li>
								<li>Accessible: make photos searchable and shareable</li>
								<li>Memorable: make memorable moments shine</li>
								<li>Easy to use: make our products easy to learn over time</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Furthermore, a similar exercise was done to define what team culture we wanted: fun, transparent, mindful, compassionate, striving to share and improve.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ESTABLISHING BEST PRACTICES FOR DESIGN PROCESS/DELIVERY =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Establishing best practices for design process/delivery (and delivering individual contributor design works)</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As a design leader, I shared my individual contributor design works at design share meetings to help establish best practices. 
							This included showcasing screen flows, prototypes, automated redlining of designs, and usage of usability testing services. 
							I usually filled in for various design needs throughout the organization, such as:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>iOS/Android mobile: sharing photos to groups of friends/family</li>
								<li>Desktop/mobile web: viewing of shared photos</li>
								<li>Android/Fire Tablet: seeing personalized photo recommendations</li>
								<li>Windows/macOS desktop apps: photos syncing to Amazon Photos service</li>
								<li>Fire TV smart television: home screen and viewing of shared photos</li>
								<li>Fire TV smart television: photos screensaver with Alexa hints and advertisements</li>
								<li>Echo Show/Spot smart devices: voice prompted image search</li>
							</ol>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							During my tenure, I was able to establish centralized team processes/outputs and grow team headcount by roughly 50%.<br />
							<br />
							
							Guest Center has continued to get more customers through fleshing out capabilities and working toward a self-service model (see the self-service signup wireframes excerpt below for another design example).<br />
							<br />
							OpenTable was a good learning experience for me to better understand the challenges of transitioning from legacy softwares. 
							During my time at OpenTable, I also took on some design team leadership responsibilities focused on team logistics and collaborating with a remote team.
							OpenTable was also one of my best experiences working collaboratively with product managers and engineers.

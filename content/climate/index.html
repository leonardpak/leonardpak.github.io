						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							By early-<time>2013</time>, Climate.com gained popularity with early users who had constantly requested expanding the service. What was once supplementary was becoming its own full-blown product.<br />
							<br />
							"We have 17 new features planned," said Powell, Climate.com's product manager. "And we have the thumbs up to move forward!"<br />
							<br />
							After looking at the feature list, my jaw dropped. These weren't merely new features &mdash; the scale of the product was increasing tenfold.
						</p>

								These weren't merely new features &mdash; the scale of the product was increasing tenfold.
							</blockquote>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							"All we have to do is add these to Climate.com," said Powell. "It'll be awesome! Now where to start...?"<br />
							<br />
							The awkward silence that filled the room that moment confirmed my suspicions. We had a long few months ahead of us.

					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The full design process led to a re-architecture of Climate.com. Before delving into that, let's look at Climate.com mobile, as it heavily influenced the re-architecture project.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== MOBILE EXPOSED CLIMATE.COM'S POTENTIAL =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Mobile exposed Climate.com's potential</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Increased interest was enough to consider creating a mobile version of Climate.com. I created several different iterations of prototypes, ranging from paper to high-fidelity, for research to assess the use cases for a potential mobile app.
						</p>

							<p class="caption for_single_image">Paper, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity prototypes used to gather feedback. <span>Work credit: Leonard Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The prototypes acted as talking points in our research for us to understand the goals users had with the data we had. Up to that point, Climate.com had only provided raw data.
						</p>

						<div class="small-12 columns end">
							<blockquote>
								The prototypes acted as talking points in our research for us to understand the goals users had with the data we had.
							</blockquote>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The research helped orient the design toward making the product user goal-oriented versus data-oriented, which set the tone for the re-architecture of Climate.com. The research also green-lit development of iOS and Android mobile apps.

						<!-- =========== STARTING THE CLIMATE.COM REARCHITECTURE =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Starting the Climate.com Re-architecture</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As I worked on adding new functionality to Climate.com, I questioned the assumption that the new features should be added to the original design. What good would an exorbitant amount of features be if the foundation was flawed? It was recipe for a bloated, not well thought-out product.
						</p>

						<div class="small-12 columns end">
							<blockquote>
								What good would an exorbitant amount of features be if the foundation was flawed?
							</blockquote>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I insisted on taking a step back to see how Climate.com could be holistically designed, accounting for features both new and old.<br />
							<br />
							My approach encompassed:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Using existing and gathering additional research to understand users' primary use cases</span></li>
								<li><span>Identifying flow and architecture inefficiencies based on the identified use cases in relation to the existing design </span></li>
								<li><span>Designing a new architecture, incorporating all current and proposed features, with efficient interaction flows based on the identified use cases</span></li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<!-- =========== GATHERING RESEARCH FOR USE CASES =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Using research to understand primary use cases</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The first priority was to gather research to understand the main scenarios in which users would use Climate.com.<br />
							<br />
							Because most research gathered to that point had been with existing customers, I used Ethn.io to reach out to prospective users to build a more complete understanding of the problem.
						</p>

							<p class="caption for_single_image">A research participant screener via ethn.io. <span>Work credit: Leonard Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As a result, we gathered more diverse research via ethnography, interviewing, and surveys to better understand our users.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ANALYZING USE CASES IN RELATION TO EXISTING DESIGN =========== -->

						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Analyzing the current design from the user's perspective</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							After identifying the primary usage scenarios from research, I compiled a set of user flows to analyze the existing design.
						</p>

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							If we were to "simply add features" to the existing product, it would be adding to an already unideal, inefficient experience. Rebuilding the architecture would be key in creating a better user experience.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== DESIGNING A NEW ARCHITECTURE =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Designing a new product architecture</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							With an understanding of the architectural issues of the existing design, along with a list of planned features from the product roadmap, I designed a new architectural framework.<br />
							<br />
							To achieve this end, I used an affinity diagram of the various features to determine potential architecture schemes that would fulfill users' primary use cases efficiently.

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							After building the new architecture, I created a low-fidelity prototype, user flows, and design mockups based off of it.
						</p>

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Indeed is the largest job search site in North America, and has been rapidly expanding internationally.<br />
							<br />
							Initially, my role at Indeed encompassed both design managerial responsibilities and lead design work for desktop/mobile web, email, and chat services.
							In the following org chart, you can see my managerial people scope:

							<p class="caption for_single_image">On the righthand side, my direct reports are in dark blue, and I also collaborated closely with other design employees in light blue. <span>Work credit: Leonard "Leo" Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Eventually, as we entered a post-COVID world which changed the way worked, I transitioned to a full-time lead design work role, as it better suited me.
						</p>

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<section id="problem">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In joining the internationalization team of Indeed, a design team had already been established, but had lacked experienced leadership guidance. <br />
							<br />
							As a hybrid design manager/individual contributor hire, how would I help a team of mostly mid-level and junior designers come together?
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The management/design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In my initial years, I focused primarily on management of the young design team.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== SETTING UP BETTER TEAM FOUNDATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Setting up better team foundations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							For setting up better team foundations, I focused on a few key areas:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Operations: running design reviews, handling performance management and hiring</li>
								<li>Research: collaboration with research vendors, arranging quicker feedback cycles</li>
								<li>Project management: managing a kanban board for design tasks, running planning/retrospectives and backlog management</li>
								<li>Collaboration/delivery: improving handoffs and design file management</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I surmised that these types of improvements were key to fitting in within Indeed's process-driven, developer-centric culture.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ENGAGING WITHIN COMPANY DESIGN COMMUNITY =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Engaging within the company's design community</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Besides focusing on my team, I also spent time engaging with the company's greater design community within Tokyo and internationally. 
							This included hosting UX events in Tokyo, disseminating design education materials, creating better collaborative spaces in Tokyo, and helping hire for other teams in Tokyo.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== RUNNING COLLABORATIVE DESIGN WORKSHOPS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Running collaborative design workshops</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Indeed has a deeply rooted culture of doing collaborative exercises. 
							Therefore another one of my key responsibilities was running collaborative design workshops. 
							I was happy to leverage my extensive experience of running workshops from my design education days.
							I frequently ran collaborative workshops both in-person and remotely.

						</div>						

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The goals of these workshops were often to: 
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Create clarity and alignment between functions on the problem, goals, and purpose of what is being accomplished</li>
								<li>Identifying potential issues, approaches, requirements, risks, and concepts</li>
								<li>Helping plan and prioritize in coming quarters/years</li>
							</ol>

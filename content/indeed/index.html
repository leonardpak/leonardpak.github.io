						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Indeed is the largest job search site in North America, and has been rapidly expanding internationally.<br />
							<br />
							Initially, my role at Indeed encompassed both design managerial responsibilities and lead design work for desktop/mobile web, email, and chat services.
							My initial managerial people scope was as follows:

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Eventually, as we entered a post-COVID working environment, I transitioned to a full-time lead designer role.

				<!-- =================================== DISCLAIMER =================================== -->
				<section id="disclaimer">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">A humble disclaimer</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As Indeed is my most recent in-house corporate work, many works are confidential and unable to be shared, due to not having been made public.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<!-- The real problem was dealing with excessive company empire building and politics, but not exactly something to write about. -->

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The management/design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In my initial years, I focused primarily on management of a young design team.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== SETTING UP BETTER TEAM FOUNDATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Setting up better team foundations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							To set up better foundations for the team, I focused on a few key areas in order to improve team operations:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>People management: running design reviews, handling performance management and hiring</li>
								<li>Research operations: utilization of and collaboration with research vendors, developing a quicker feedback cycle process</li>
								<li>Project management: managing a kanban board for design tasks, running planning/retrospectives and backlog management</li>
								<li>Collaboration/delivery: improving handoffs and design file management</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							These types of improvements were key to functioning well within Indeed's heavily process-driven, developer-centric culture.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ENGAGING WITHIN COMPANY DESIGN COMMUNITY =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Engaging within the company's design community</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I also spent time engaging with the greater design community. 
							This included hosting UX events in Tokyo, disseminating design education materials within Indeed Tokyo, creating better collaborative spaces in our offices, and helping hire for other teams in Tokyo.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== RUNNING COLLABORATIVE DESIGN WORKSHOPS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Running collaborative design workshops</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Indeed has a deeply rooted culture of doing collaborative exercises. 
							Therefore, another of my key responsibilities was running collaborative design workshops. 
							I frequently ran collaborative workshops both in-person and remotely.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">

							</p>
						</div>						

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The goals of these workshops were often to: 
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Create clarity and alignment between functions on the problem, goals, and purpose</li>
								<li>Identifying potential issues, approaches, requirements, risks, and concepts</li>
								<li>Helping plan and prioritize coming quarters/years</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<!-- =========== SWITCHING TO PRIMARILY DESIGN WORK =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Switching to full-time lead designer role</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							After COVID changed the way we worked, I switched to a full-time lead designer role. 
							My works ranged from working on consumer/B2B web/chat products, to internal localization tools.

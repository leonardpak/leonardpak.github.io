						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Indeed is the largest job search site in North America, and has been rapidly expanding internationally.<br />
							<br />
							Initially, my role at Indeed encompassed both design managerial responsibilities and lead design work for desktop/mobile web, email, and chat services.
							My initial managerial people scope was as follows:

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Eventually, as we entered a post-COVID working environment, I transitioned to a full-time lead designer role.

				<section id="disclaimer">

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">A humble disclaimer</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As Indeed is my most recent in-house corporate work, many works are confidential and unable to be shared, due to not having been made public.
						</p>
					</div>

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<!-- The real problem was dealing with excessive company empire building and politics, but not exactly something to write about. -->

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The management/design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In my initial years, I focused primarily on management of a young design team.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== SETTING UP BETTER TEAM FOUNDATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Setting up better team foundations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							To set up better foundations for the team, I focused on a few key areas in order to improve team operations:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>People management: running design reviews, handling performance management and hiring</li>
								<li>Research operations: utilization of and collaboration with research vendors, developing a quicker feedback cycle process</li>
								<li>Project management: managing a kanban board for design tasks, running planning/retrospectives and backlog management</li>
								<li>Collaboration/delivery: improving handoffs and design file management</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							These types of improvements were key to functioning well within Indeed's heavily process-driven, developer-centric culture.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ENGAGING WITHIN DESIGN COMMUNITY =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Engaging within the design community</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I also spent time engaging with the greater design community. 
							This included hosting UX events in Tokyo, disseminating design education materials within Indeed Tokyo, creating better collaborative spaces in our offices, and helping hire for other teams in Tokyo.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== RUNNING COLLABORATIVE DESIGN WORKSHOPS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Running collaborative design workshops</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Indeed has a deeply rooted culture of doing collaborative exercises. 
							Therefore, another of my key responsibilities was running collaborative design workshops. 
							I frequently ran collaborative workshops both in-person and remotely.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/empathymaps.jpg" width="1380" alt="Image of in-person empathy map exercises representing job seekers and employers from different countries" />

								Examples of artifacts from both in-person and remote collaborative design workshops. 
								Above are images of empathy map exercises done with groups in-person. 
								Below is an image of brainstorming sessions done with groups remotely.
							</p>
						</div>						

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The goals of these workshops were often to: 
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Create clarity and alignment between functions on the problem, goals, and purpose</li>
								<li>Identifying potential issues, approaches, requirements, risks, and concepts</li>
								<li>Helping plan and prioritize coming quarters/years</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<!-- =========== SWITCHING TO PRIMARILY DESIGN WORK =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Switching to full-time lead designer role</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							After COVID changed the way we worked, I switched to a full-time lead designer role. 
							My works ranged from working on consumer/B2B web/chat products, to internal localization tools.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== DESIGN: LINE PROFILE CREATION AND JOB RECOMMENDATION CARDS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Design: creating job profiles via LINE and getting job recommendations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Many businesses in Japan engage with consumers using a popular chat app in Japan called LINE. 
							Indeed wanted to leverage LINE to message prospective job seekers of new job possibilities.<br />
							<br />
							Through LINE, users could receive images with interactive hotspots to facilitate interaction. 
							In order to create designs for this, I not only created visual assets, but also provided code for use in both prototypes and production.
						</p>
						
						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/line-profile.jpg" width="1380" alt="Image of a LINE card that invites users to see job information and corresponding code" />
							<img src="img/line-cards.jpg" width="1380" alt="Image of LINE cards created using a code simulator" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">
								Examples of assets created, along with corresponding code handed off to developers. 
								Above is an image used to invite LINE users to see job information, with code indicating interactive hotspots. 
								Below are interactive LINE "flex message" cards being used to display job information, being simulated using production-capable code.

						</div>	

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Normally, I do not recommend jumping into code for designs, but with the specific constraints of the LINE messaging app, 
							and a desire to create intended interactions for use in a prototype for usability testing, it made sense to pursue.<br />
							<br />
							Consequently, with the help of a UX developer, I was able to create a working prototype within the LINE chat app, 
							and then later created a usability research guide for our research vendor to use in usability testing.

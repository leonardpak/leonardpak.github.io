						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The context</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Indeed is the largest job search site in North America, and has been rapidly expanding internationally.<br />
							<br />
							Initially, my role at Indeed encompassed both design managerial responsibilities and lead design work for desktop/mobile web, email, and chat services.
							In the following org chart, you can see my managerial people scope:
						</p>

							<p class="caption for_single_image">On the righthand side, my direct reports are in dark blue, and I also collaborated closely with other design employees in light blue. <span>Work credit: Leonard "Leo" Pak</span></p>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Eventually, as we entered a post-COVID world which changed the way worked, I transitioned to a full-time lead design work role, as it better suited me.
						</p>

				<!-- =================================== PROBLEM =================================== -->
				<section id="problem">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The problem</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In joining the internationalization team of Indeed, a design team had already been established, but had lacked experienced leadership guidance. <br />
							<br />
							As a hybrid design manager/individual contributor hire, how would I help a team of mostly mid-level and junior designers come together?
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- =================================== PROCESS =================================== -->
				<section id="process">
					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The management/design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							In my initial years, I focused primarily on management of the young design team.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== SETTING UP BETTER TEAM FOUNDATIONS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Setting up better team foundations</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							For setting up better team foundations, I focused on a few key areas:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Operations: running design reviews, handling performance management and hiring</li>
								<li>Research: collaboration with research vendors, arranging quicker feedback cycles</li>
								<li>Project management: managing a kanban board for design tasks, running planning/retrospectives and backlog management</li>
								<li>Collaboration/delivery: improving handoffs and design file management</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I surmised that these types of improvements were key to fitting in within Indeed's process-driven, developer-centric culture.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ENGAGING WITHIN COMPANY DESIGN COMMUNITY =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Engaging within the company's design community</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Besides focusing on my team, I also spent time engaging with the company's greater design community within Tokyo and internationally. 
							This included hosting UX events in Tokyo, disseminating design education materials, creating better collaborative spaces in Tokyo, and helping hire for other teams in Tokyo.
						</p>
















						<!-- =========== RUNNING WORKSHOPS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Centralizing people management</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I started managing the team through setting up 1:1s, interviewing/hiring, setting up onboarding, running performance reviews, allocating designers to trainings, etc.
						</p>
						
						<!-- =========== SWITCHING TO PRIMARILY DESIGN WORK =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Establishing design principles</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I ran brainstorming workshops with the designers to align on team design principles:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Secure: make photo storage reliable, safe, private</li>
								<li>Accessible: make photos searchable and shareable</li>
								<li>Memorable: make memorable moments shine</li>
								<li>Easy to use: make our products easy to learn over time</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Furthermore, a similar exercise was done to define what team culture we wanted to have: fun, transparent, mindful, compassionate, and striving to share and improve.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== ESTABLISHING BEST PRACTICES =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Establishing best practices (through delivering individual contributor design works)</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							As a design leader, I shared my individual contributor design works at design share meetings to help establish best practices. 
							This included showcasing screen flows, prototypes, automated redlining of designs, and usage of usability testing services. 
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">
							<img src="img/iosshareflow.jpg" width="1380" alt="Page from iOS photos sharing screen flow documentation" />
							<img src="img/desktopwebgroups.jpg" width="1380" alt="Image of design for the desktop website's shared photos view" />
							<img src="img/firetvhome.jpg" width="1380" alt="The Fire TV home screen with viewing shared photos" />
							<img src="img/firetvscreensaver.jpg" width="1380" alt="The Fire TV screensaver featuring Alexa voice hints" />
							<p class="caption for_single_image">

								the Fire TV photos home screen, and the Fire TV screensaver featuring Alexa. <span>Work credit: Leonard "Leo" Pak</span>
							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							Oftentimes I filled in for design needs throughout the organization, such as for these projects:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>iOS/Android mobile: sharing photos to groups of friends/family</li>
								<li>Desktop/mobile web: viewing of shared photos</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="fixed_width_content">
						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The results (and some reflection)</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Amazon had traditionally been engineering and product driven, and only in the few years before my tenure, had started to incorporate design-centric organizational practices.<br />
							<br />
							During my tenure, while completing some individual contributor work across multiple platforms,  I was able to take on many managerial responsibilities 
							and learned a lot about establishing a centralized design team. We grew our team headcount by roughly 50%, while setting up a good foundation for improved design work in the future.<br />
							<br />
							In hindsight, some other initiatives I wish I could have worked on to improve our design foundation and culture includes:
						</p>
						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li>Creating a better collaborative design space</li>
								<li>Encouraging more paired design work</li>
								<li>Being an earlier participant in organizational roadmapping</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							I hope that in future roles, I can continue to shape design orgs' operations, culture, coaching, and foundations.
						</p>

						<div class="downloads large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">

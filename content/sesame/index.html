							My design partner and I were approached for freelance design and consultation soon after a startup, Candy House, had received their seed funding. Within weeks, they would be making a product announcement for Sesame, a smart home security lock.<br />
							<br />
							Candy House needed critical design assistance to transition from working prototype to marketable product on a tight deadline. How would we help Candy House move forward to full-fledged product on limited budget and time?

							Jeremy, Candy House's co-founder, is demoing the installation of a prototype smart lock for us. After syncing the lock to a crude mobile app, the whole installation is done in under a minute.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							"Other companies' locks are too complicated," says Jeremy as he shows us competitors and their arduous installations. "Our product needs to stay simple."<br />
							<br />
							During our initial meeting, we came to an agreement that our primary responsibilities would include:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Creating a brand identity embodying the company's values while differentiating it from the competition.</span></li>

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Throughout the process, my design partner and I held many stakeholder meetings. Our initial meetings and work focused on understanding the product's users and the competitive landscape. 
						</p>

						<!-- =========== UNDERSTANDING USERS AND COMPETITION =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Understanding the users and the competition</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Candy House was able to share their existing research with us regarding user motivations and typical lock usage patterns. Given the constraints, competitive analysis and user sentiment analysis were the most feasible research approaches we could add to the existing research.
						</p>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							After studying competitor hardware, competitor interfaces, and both professional and user reviews, it became clear certain quirks gave users frustration. In particular:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>The installation processes were difficult for most smart locks</span></li>
								<li><span>The interaction of locking or unlocking locks could be unclear (!!!)</span></li>
								<li><span>The status of a lock being locked or unlocked could be unclear (!!!)</span></li>
								<li><span>The architecture or layouts of the mobile apps could be confusing</span></li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<!-- =========== UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANY TO CREATE A BRAND =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Understanding the company to create a brand</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Our next stakeholder meetings and work focused on understanding the company, their vision, and their goals. In doing so, we conducted exercises to assess the company's values to guide them toward an overall brand direction.
						</p>

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							My design partner was chiefly responsible for the brand assets that followed our exercises, creating mood boards and presenting different brand approaches. During this time I advised on the ramifications of certain brand directions.<br />
							<br />
							Based on the company values we identified, we steered Candy House toward a minimalist and technological brand direction, differentiating the company through a playful, colorful aesthetic.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING THE HARDWARE DESIGN =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Understanding hardware constraints and improving the hardware design</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Next, we focused on understanding the product hardware and its constraints. This was crucial to make an interface design that matched the capabilities of the hardware. Furthermore, based on the new brand direction, we provided design recommendations for:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Size and shape &mdash; ideal product dimensions and shapes</span></li>
								<li><span>Material and color &mdash; materials and colors appropriate to certain contexts or user preferences</span></li>
								<li><span>Ambiance and sound &mdash; how environmental context, sound, and light could impact usage</span></li>
								<li><span>Tactile response &mdash; the significance of the grip and feel of the knob</span></li>

						<!-- =========== DESIGNING THE WEBSITE AND MOBILE APPS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Designing the website and mobile apps</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							We then shifted our focus toward designing the software interfaces. My design partner worked on designing the company's marketing website, while I focused on designing iOS and Android mobile apps.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							My goal for the mobile app was to mitigate the issues users had with competitor apps while aligning with the hardware's capabilities. I explored various lock interaction, lock status, and mobile architecture approaches through sketches.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Over time, I worked with Candy House's remote developers to create iterations of wireframes and screen flows until we came to a solution that worked within the constraints of the hardware.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Following the approval of the wireframes, I created an interactive prototype to further communicate the overall flow and feel of the mobile design.

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							With product launch only weeks away and budget constraints, I provided guidelines for transitioning the iOS mobile app design to an Android mobile app design. This helped save time and budget versus creating a whole new set of Android-specific deliverables.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							With the branding, website design, and mobile app designs completed, our remaining work focused on ongoing design support and design strategy moving forward.

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The results (and reflections)</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The website launched alongside a Kickstarter campaign that hit its $100,000 funding target within 9 hours. The mobile apps launched alongside initial product shipments at the end of <time>2015</time>.<br />
							<br />
							Reviews have spoken well of the design of the hardware, the packaging, and the mobile app. The mobile app has been described as "simple", "straightforward", "smooth" and "easy to use". Most importantly, the interaction for and status of the lock was never confusing. A competitor also changed its mobile app architecture to be similar.<br />
							<br />
							This project was an interesting challenge. Making the right compromises to best deal with constraints was definitely the theme of this project (as expected with an early-stage startup).<br />

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">A humble disclaimer</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							This startup client's limited budget and timeline necessitated an expedited design process. There are more idealized ways to do design work, but I like to adapt to the circumstances of my clients/stakeholders.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							A design colleague and I were approached for freelance design and consultation after the startup, Candy House, received seed funding. Within weeks, they planned making a product announcement for Sesame, a smart home security lock.<br />
							<br />
							Candy House needed design assistance to transition from a working prototype to a marketable product on a tight deadline. How would we help them move forward on a limited budget and timeline?

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Jeremy, Candy House's co-founder, demos the installation of a prototype smart lock for us. After syncing the lock to a prototype mobile app, the whole installation is completed in under a minute.

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							"Other companies' locks are too complicated," said Jeremy as he also showed us competitors' locks and their arduous installations. "Our product must stay simple."<br />
							<br />
							In our initial meeting, we agreed that our primary responsibilities would include:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Creating a brand identity embodying the company's values, differentiating it from competition.</span></li>
								<li><span>Designing the company's first website and mobile apps based on approved brand direction.</span></li>
								<li><span>Providing consultation for product design work to be done after completion of our contract.</span></li>

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The design process</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Throughout the process, my design colleague and I held multiple stakeholder meetings. Our initial meetings focused on understanding the product's prospective users and the competitive landscape. 
						</p>

						<!-- =========== UNDERSTANDING USERS AND COMPETITION =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Understanding users and the competition</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Candy House shared their existing research with us regarding user motivations and typical lock usage patterns. Given the constraints, competitive analysis and user sentiment analysis were the most feasible research approaches we do in addition to the existing research.
						</p>

						<div class="single_image large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns end">

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							After studying competitor hardware, interfaces, and both professional and user reviews, it became clear certain quirks gave users frustration. In particular:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>The installation process for most smart locks were difficult</span></li>
								<li><span>The interaction to lock or unlock the smart locks could be unclear (!)</span></li>
								<li><span>The status of a lock being locked or unlocked could be unclear (!)</span></li>
								<li><span>The design architecture of the mobile apps could be confusing</span></li>
							</ol>
						</div>

						<!-- =========== UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANY TO CREATE A BRAND =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Understanding the company's values to create a brand</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Our next stakeholder meetings focused on understanding the company, their vision, and their goals. We conducted exercises to determine the company's values and aligned them toward an overall brand direction.
						</p>

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							My design colleague was chiefly responsible for creation of the brand assets that followed our exercises. My role during this time was consulting on the practical ramifications of certain brand directions.<br />
							<br />
							Based on the company values we identified, we steered Candy House toward a minimalist and technological brand direction, differentiating the company through playful, colorful aesthetic matching their company name.
						</p>

						<!-- =========== UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING THE HARDWARE DESIGN =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Understanding hardware constraints and improving the industrial design</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Next, we focused on understanding the product hardware prototype and its constraints. This was crucial to design an interface that matched hardware capabilities. We also provided design recommendations based on the new brand direction:
						</p>

						<div class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							<ol>
								<li><span>Size and shape &mdash; ideal product shapes</span></li>
								<li><span>Material and color &mdash; according to context or user preference</span></li>
								<li><span>Ambiance and sound &mdash; how environmental context, sound, and lighting could enhance usage</span></li>
								<li><span>Tactile sensation &mdash; the importance of the grip and feel of the knob</span></li>

						<!-- =========== DESIGNING THE WEBSITE AND MOBILE APPS =========== -->
						<h4 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">Designing the website and mobile apps</h4>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							We then shifted focus toward designing the interfaces. My design partner colleague worked on the company's marketing site, while I focused on designing iOS and Android mobile apps.

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							My goal for the mobile app was to mitigate the issues users had with competitor apps while aligning with hardware capabilities. I explored various lock interaction, lock status, and mobile architecture approaches through sketches.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Over time, I collaborated with Candy House's developers to create iterations of screen flows until we came to a solution that worked within hardware constraints.

						</div>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							Following approval of the wireframes and screen flows, I created an interactive prototype to further communicate the overall flow and feel of the mobile design using created visual assets.

							I also provided guidelines for the subtle differences between the iOS mobile app design to an Android mobile app design.

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							With the branding, website design, and mobile app designs completed, our remaining work focused on ongoing design support and product design strategy moving forward. This included working on a marketing campaign with <a href="http://sandwich.co/" target="_blank">Sandwich</a>:

						<h3 class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">The results (and reflections)</h3>

						<p class="large-offset-1 large-9 medium-10 small-12 columns end">
							The marketing website launched alongside a Kickstarter campaign that hit its $100,000 funding target within 9 hours. The mobile apps launched alongside initial product shipments.<br />
							<br />
							Reviews spoke well of the design of the hardware, packaging, and mobile app, being described as "simple", "straightforward", "smooth" and "easy to use". <em>Most importantly</em>, the interaction for and the status of the lock wasn't confusing. A competitor also changed its mobile app architecture to be nearly identical to ours.<br />
							<br />
							This client engagement was an interesting challenge in making the right compromises to best deal with constraints (as expected with an early-stage startup).
							Since then, we've continued occasional client work with Candy House, who went on to be a successful smart device company based in Tokyo, Japan.<br />
